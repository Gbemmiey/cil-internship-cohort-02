# Cloud Computing Service Models

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS enables the customer to provision fundamental resources (computing, storage, networks, etc) where the customer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software (operating systems and applications)

Infrastructure management tasks like patching (updates), backup, etc are performed by the customers in IaaS. Examples of IaaS products include Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure virtual machines.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS provides platforms for customers to develop, run and manage applications without the complexity of building and managing infrastructure (hosts).

Infrastructure management tasks (updates, patching, etc.) are handled by the PaaS provider while the customer is responsible for scaling & building applications for high availability.PaaS providers include AWS Elastic BeanStalk, Google App Engine, Heroku, DigitalOcean etc.

## Function as a Service (FaaS)

FaaS provides an environment where users can develop, run and manage application code (specifically functions) without having to worry about provisioning or managing servers, or scaling the infrastructure.

Examples of FaaS providers are AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, etc.

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS is a model where a software provider hosts and delivers software functionality and applications over the internet to users.

SaaS combines infrastructure and software running in the cloud.  Examples of SaaS includes Amazon Workspaces, Microsoft Office 365, Netflix, Dropbox, Gmail.
