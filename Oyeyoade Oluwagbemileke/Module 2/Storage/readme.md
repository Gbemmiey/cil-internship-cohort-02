A Database is a collection of information stored within a computer. Databases allow computers to store information in an organized and easily searchable way.

## Kinds of Databases

### **Relational Databases**

Relational databases store data in rows and columns. Rows contain all the information about one entry, and columns are the attributes that separate the data points. The schema for a relational database is fixed, i.e columns must be locked before data entry. However, schemas of relational databases can be amended if the database is altered entirely and taken offline.

Data in relational databases is queried by using Structured Query Language (SQL). Relational databases are commonly used for traditional applications, customer relationship management (CRM), e-commerce, etc.

### **Non-relational Databases**

Non-relational databases store data by using one of many storage models, including key-value pairs, documents, and graphs. Non-relational schemas are dynamic, and information can be added rapidly. In a non-relational database, each row does not have to contain data for each column.

Data in non-relational databases is queried by focusing on collections of documents. Key-value databases are commonly used for internet-scale applications, real-time bidding, shopping carts, and customer preferences.

### **Graph databases**

The graph is a collection of nodes and edges where each node is used to represent an entity and each edge describes the relationship between entities. A graph database is a type of NoSQL database that uses graph theory to store, map and query relationships.

These relationships are stored inside the database along with the original data. It might be used to mine data about customers from social media.

#### **Cloud Databases**

A cloud database is one that runs over the internet. The data is stored on a local hard drive or server but the information is available online.

#### **Distributed Database**

A distributed database is spread out over multiple devices within the same location or over a network. A distributed database offer better reliability, increased speed.
