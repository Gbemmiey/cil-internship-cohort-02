# **Cloud Service Models**

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS is a cloud service model in which computing infrastructure is managed and accessed over the internet. It allows users to outsource their IT infrastructures (such as servers, networking storage, etc) to IaaS providers and avoid the cost and complexity of purchasing, and managing the physical servers.

Infrastructure management tasks (e.g software updates, integrations, etc.) are handled by the user in IaaS while the IaaS provider manages the hosts (hardware - servers, network devices, storage devices) in their data centers.

Examples:

* Google
  * Google Compute Engine (GCE)
  * Google Cloud Filestore
  * Google Cloud Storage
* AWS
  * AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
  * AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
  * AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)
* Azure
  * Azure Virtual Machines (VM)
  * Azure Blob Storage

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS enables users (developers) to develop, test, run, and manage their applications. PaaS providers often support multiple programming languages, tools and frameworks.

PaaS is based on the IaaS model. However, the cloud provider manages complex back-end infrastructure, including computing resources, operating systems, software updates, storage, networking, and integrations while developers focus on developing software functionality for their end users.

Examples:

* Heroku
* DigitalOcean
* Linode
* Netlify
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* Google App Engine
* Salesforce Platform

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS offers applications that are accessed over the web and are not managed by the user but by the software/cloud provider. It provides web software and apps to complete business tasks (e.g Jira, Trello, Confluence) in teams (companies/organizations). It also provides software as a service to end users (e.g Netflix, Gmail, etc).

Examples:

* Jira (Atlassian)
* Trello
* Slack
* Dropbox
* Outlook
* Google Apps
  * GMail
  * Drive
* Zoom
* Netflix
